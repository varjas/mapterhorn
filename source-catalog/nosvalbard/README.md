# nosvalbard

There is a nice website which lists the files. There are no direct download links. But there is a button which allows to download the full directory as a single zip file. Unzip this outer zip file to source-store/nosvalbard. Then proceed with the Justfile to unzip the inner zip files and work with the tifs.
